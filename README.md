# Movie analysis in Power BI

One of my first reports in Power BI, where I analised Movies data base.

## Few aspects, that you can find in my report:

- Best/worst movies by Critics
- Best/worst movies by Audience
- Interactive panel, where you can find movie's year of reliese, genre, rating
- Relation between top rated movies by audience/critics and gross
- Top 20 movies by gross
- Most popular genre by year
- Most popular movies by year

There is basic preview in .pdf format and main Power Bi file.
